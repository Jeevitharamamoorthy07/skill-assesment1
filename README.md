Write an assembly language program in 8051 to search for a given number in an array of N elements and display whether the number is found or not found.

Aim:

To write an assembly language program to search for a given number in an array of N elements using the 8051 microcontroller.

⚙️ Algorithm:

Start the program.

Load the base address of the array.

Load the count of elements (N).

Load the number to be searched.

Compare each element of the array with the given number.

If a match is found, display “FOUND”.

If no match is found after checking all elements, display “NOT FOUND”.
